Go to Racing Shops: Ask if they need software/data solutions.
Partner with Sim Racing Communities: Offer data coaching.
Network on LinkedIn & Reddit: Join motorsports tech groups.
Offer a Free Data Report: Give teams a sample to showcase value.

4. Tech Demo: Show Your Skills to Racing Teams
To convince teams, you should prepare a small, working tech demo. Here’s how:
Tech Demo 1: Telemetry Data Analysis
Goal: Write a Python script that reads telemetry data (CSV format) and highlights the following:
Lap times per session
Braking & acceleration zones
Sector time comparisons
Suggested improvement areas
Tools:
Python (pandas, matplotlib)
Sample telemetry data (iRacing, MoTeC, or open-source datasets)
Deliverable: A simple Python script that generates a visual report of a driver's performance.

Tech Demo 2: AI-Based Setup Suggestions
Goal: Create a basic machine learning model that predicts the best suspension setup based on:
Track temperature
Tire wear
Downforce levels
Tools:
Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Sample race car setup data (open-source)
Deliverable: A simple AI tool where teams input conditions, and it suggests suspension & tire settings.

Tech Demo 3: Custom Dashboard
Goal: Build a React-based web app that displays:
Live lap times
Throttle/brake data
Tire temps & pressures
Tools:
React.js (for frontend)
Raspberry Pi / Arduino (for hardware integration)
Firebase (for data storage)
Deliverable: A simple pit-wall dashboard that updates in real-time.


5. Business Expansion & Long-Term Vision
